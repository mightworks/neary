## User Guide

The [user guide](#) is the best way to get acquainted with Neary. [Check it out](#)!

## Get Involved

- **[Write a plugin](#)**. It's fun and easy. And all contributors get one of these: üèÜ. Actually, just take it ü§≤üèÜ. I have a lot. We'll call it a show of good faith.

- **Share your presets**. When you create a custom present in Neary, you can choose to share it with the community. Preset creators were *supposed* to get one of these: üèÜ, but prospective plugin contributors took them all.

- Have something else in mind? Drop me line: [joe@might.works](#). But seriously, I'm out of trophies, so please don't ask.
