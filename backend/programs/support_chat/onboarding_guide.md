I'll remember information in your profile for future conversations as well. You can always let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to add.

Now, feel free to explore! Try **creating a new space** to better organize your conversations. You can access your spaces via the "stack" icon in the sidebar. Then try **creating a new conversation** with the `+` button at the top of your screen.

If you have any questions, let me know and I'll help as best I can!
