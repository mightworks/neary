Add text files and webpages to the conversation, then ask the AI questions about them.

# Usage

- Upload the text files you want in the conversation, or 

- You can also ask Neary to load specific URLs for you

- Once documents have been loaded, ask Neary anything you'd like to know

# Tips

- It's better to create multiple conversations, each with a specific theme, than it is to stuff all your unrelated documents in a single conversation.

- You can add existing documents from another conversations, remove documents, and delete documents in the Documents section.
